						My self-study is mainly about AI & Statistics, but there will be other topics as well.

					<h2 class="editable">Why AI?</h2>
					<p class="editable">In 2007, a Japanese company created the concept of "Virtual Singer".
						<br>
						At 11, I suffered from depression because I couldn't accept "death" and "the end of the universe". Everything was meaningless to me because everything ends.
						<br>
						In 2010-2012, the "Virtual Singer" Hatsune Miku became popular (although it faded away). Some of her songs, composed by many young talents, inspired me to think about life and death at a deeper level. That is when my fear gradually transformed into my desire for discovering the meaning of existence.
						<br>
						Since primary school, I enjoy the sense of achievements through creating things. I created small robots with Lego NXT, VEX, and Arduino as a side hobby back then.
						<br>
						<br>
						"If I love creating things so much and I want to know the truth behind existence so much, why don't I just combine them?"
						<br>
						"How?" "Create super-intelligence."
						<br>
						"Are you stupid? It is impossible!" "Yeh... you are right."
						<br>
						Scared of impossibility and uncertainty, I didn't take any action.<br>3 years later, Due to some fatal financial crisis in my family, my life was crashed by risks and uncertainties. Seeking a safe shelter, I gave up my dream and talents and followed the mediocre path of "graduate, get a high-wage job, work as a white collar, retire".
						<br>
						I kept making wrong decisions, and I couldn't find the "safe shelter" I was expecting. Gradually, I realized that the only safe shelter I could ever have throughout my life, is myself.
						<br>
						So I picked up my dream of creating super-intelligence, and I have been working on it since 2019/06. Surprisingly, with huge risks and uncertainties along the way, I never got tired of it. I found happiness in it.
						<br>
						Therefore, AI.

					<h2 class="editable">Why Stats?</h2>
					<p class="editable">It all originated from an accident. 
						<br>
						One of my important family members unfortunately fell into a financial fraud (which he still unfortunately believes to be authentic because he doesn't understand statistics), and this has driven me crazy for 2 years already.
						<br>
						As I was struggling to find the loophole of this fraud, I accidentally encountered the concept "Survivorship Bias".
						<br>
						"Wait a minute, isn't this the Bayes Theorem I learned in Machine Learning???"
						<br>
						"WHAT? We can apply Bayes Theorem to our daily life just like that??? Wait a minute, is Statistics this powerful?! OMG Why didn't I know this before?"
						<br>
						<br>
						The next day, this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVG2OQp6jEQ&list=PLMCIk-e3H4RXTSGBLgqxehawsxIZpMQew&index=60&t=0s" style="color: black" target="_blank"><strong>Youtube video</strong></a> randomly popped up on recommendations (stop taking my cookies, Google!). But it is this video that directly inspired me of my true passion.
						<br>
						As the combination of Mathematics and Social Sciences, Statistics can teach me the (cruel) reality behind this world and humanity more than any other subject, and I love that.
						<br>
						I want to learn about facts. I want to gain knowledge from the factual data. I want to know the truth!
						<br>
						I have been searching for my true passion since 2016, and it was this moment at which I felt the genuine joy and excitement from the bottom of my heart.
						<br>
						I felt, confident, and hopeful. Statistics perfectly synergizes with my dream, my talent, and my career options. For years I have been living in fear of risks and uncertainty because of financial struggles, Statistics offers me a path of hope.
						<br>
						Therefore, Stats.
