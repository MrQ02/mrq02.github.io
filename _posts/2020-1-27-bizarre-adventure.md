## 2017/01

As I was applying to those "top unis" in the US, the bad news came out of my expectation: my family went broke. My father, who had never wept in front of me for 18 years, shed tears. 
    
I had been given everything I wanted: barbecues, high-class foods, finest wines, field trips, parties, netflix & chill, easy grades & math achievements, ... I barely put any effort in life, and I never took anything seriously. I had searched for challenges at certain times, but I always gave up immediately as I saw no necessity of challenging myself. 

I was shocked at that moment. I didn't know what to do. I didn't even know what to say. It was too sudden for me. All the insecurities and uncertainties sealed behind my "wonderful life" came out altogether.
