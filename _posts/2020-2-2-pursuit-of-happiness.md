There is only one thing I have been doing throughout the past 3 years -- seeking happiness.

## 2017 1st half

I have lived a pretty decent life before. I was given everything I wanted: barbecues, high-class foods, finest wines, field trips, parties, netflix & chill, easy grades & math achievements, ... I barely put any effort in life, and I never took anything seriously. I had searched for challenges at certain times, but I always gave up immediately as I saw no necessity of challenging myself. 

I was happy, but I was bored. What was the point of living when everything came as granted? I applied to those so-called "top unis" in the US to seek changes in life, but I actually didn't know what kind of changes I was seeking. I chose Electrical Engineering as my major simply because I wanted to be as cool as Tony Stark. I was pretty childish.

At the night of Jan 31st, 2017, my family went broke. My "man-shall-never-cry" dad shed tears. My mom went crazy. My sister was scared by my parents and cried. But as stupid as I was, I had no idea that my life would change dramatically afterwards.

I didn't check the college admission results because obviously I couldn't afford US colleges any more. The only thing I remember was that MIT deferred my early application. Owing to my best Finnish friend in high school, I got to know that Finland offers free college education, so I went there. 

## 2017 2nd half - 2018 1st half

I was on the plane to Finland on Aug 15th, 2017. I was neither scared nor excited. I was lost. I had never faced uncertainties before, and I really don't know what "unknown" tastes like. 

After school starts, I started pushing myself: taking online courses on finance & management, seeking research opportunities with various professors in different departments, working on inverse problem of radon transform, working in a tech company on Object Detection, following Behzad Razavi's youtube lectures on Microelectronics, volunteering in startup conferences, joining robotics laboratory.

I was not happy at all. The more I dig into such tech fields, the more I became confused with what the heck I was doing with my life. I sought happiness through pushing myself so hard into engineering, but I didn't find any. 

And one day, out of the blue, my father contacted me, and boom! He went into a financial fraud without realizing it! At shocked as I was, I had no idea that my life would change dramatically afterwards. 

To briefly summarize it, there has been many fraudsters in China making huge money through selling some brainwashing bull\*\*\*\* of "successology". Such so-called "successology" has been proven to be completely useless and ineffective, but people who are brainwashed by it are addicted. My dad, desperately searching for a solution to save my family, believed in this bull\*\*\*\*, became a fully brainwashed fanatic, and took many more debts to pay for this bull\*\*\*\* course. 

I raged and argued with him for the entire day. I searched everywhere on the internet for a way to anti-brainwash my dad throughout the entire March, but he became more and more resistant to my words. After accepting the fact that my dad has no future (as most people who became fanatic about such "successology" ended up with a dead future), I realized that I must save my family. 

But how? I desperately searched the entire internet for a solution, but there was none. I told my best friends about it, but they couldn't give me any suggestion. They tried to tell me to calm down and live the Scandinavian happy life, but I could not tolerate the word "happiness" at all as I believed that I didn't deserve any. With no solution and no optimization available for my future, all the insecurities hidden behind my "wonderful life" came out altogether and dragged me into depression. 

I started to make irrational decisions. I blamed all my depression on the country Finland and the major IT, so I decided to transfer. I blamed God for my useless aptitude in Mathematics, as I thought Mathematics couldn't make me rich. With insufficient information I found online, I falsely claimed to myself that Economics was the only "money-making" major, and I desperately listed out the top schools for Economics based on those rankings like QS. However, it was April, during which most colleges do not accept applications. The only choice left for me was Keio University in Japan. Without a single hesitation or thorough research on this university and Japan, I applied and went there for the sole purpose of "making money". 

## 2018 2nd half - 2019 1st half

What happens when a man makes irrational decisions? He regrets. 

Just like one year ago, I started pushing myself hard. But this time, I was pushing myself desperately for connections and money-making opportunities. Little did I know that Japan is actually a very bad choice for money-making because of its conventional, outdated management system and social structure. As a matter of fact, Finland offers many more opportunities for gaining wealth than Japan in my opinion. What's worse, I found my math aptitude completely useless in this program of Keio University, as this program offers a Bachelor of Arts in Economics. I had to take mandatory history classes that I have absolutely zero interest in. The fact that I might have already ruined my own future led me to suicidal thoughts at the end of 2018. I did not know why I didn't kill myself, but I did have a very thorough re-consideration of my life choices and applied to Bocconi University in Italy.

But little did I know, 2019 was even worse! I was accepted to Bocconi, but some of my friends told me that Italy is not a good place for Chinese to work in and that I had a higher chance to become wealthy in Japan than in Italy. Without further consideration or research, I foolishly believed in my friends' words and chose to stay in Japan, a decision that I regretted throughout the entire 2019. 

The stubborn convention of Japanese academics hit me really hard. I literally went to the Student Office for over 100 times throughout the year for the following things: 

I got to know two options for my personal future: Quantitative Finance and Data Science, in which my Math talents will pay off. However, this PEARL program does not have sufficient English teachers to offer Math courses in English. Therefore, I have 2 options: 
1. take Japanese-taught Math courses. However, I don't speak Japanese! Moreover, these courses are NOT counted into credits or GPA calculation!
2. take English-taught Data Science courses and seminars in another city at the cost of 1.5-hour commuting. However, there is a conventional maximum credit requirement stating that I can only take a maximum of 2 English-taught courses from other faculties in the second year of my studies. 
I had to learn Japanese just for Math credits. How ridiculous. There are many more strict rules regarding research opportunities and course selection that I was completely fed up with. But anyway, I was crashed down by situational constraints.

## 2019 2nd half: The Pursuit of Happiness

But how are these things related to the pursuit of happiness?

They guided me to find my true passion. I haven't found it yet, but I am very close to it. 

But how is that possible? You don't even have the money to pursue any passion, and you are restrained by your current environment!

Life reveals your intrinsic self when you have nothing to lose. 

I followed my desperate need for money, made irrational decisions, and ruined myself. I am left with no options. If I keep myself entangled in the desperation of "I have no money. My family is broken.", I will keep making irrational decisions and eventually kill my future. Instead of trying to optimize everything in life, if I just calmly accept the reality, get out of the desperation, make the most out of what I have, and just do my best in life,

That, ladies and gentlemen, is happiness.

I didn't think of Data Science as an option for no reason. I didn't work on an Object Detection project for a company for no reason. I didn't take online courses on Artificial Intelligence for no reason. Though the desperate need of money had driven me crazy, I never gave up on my dream of creating superintelligence.

It is impractical, I know. The global trend of AI development disappoints me a lot, because data-driven statistical methods should never be considered as a form of intelligence in my opinion -- they are pattern recognition algorithms. The market finds statistical learning useful for optimization in various aspects, and they overhype it. The actual Artificial Intelligence is still at the research stage.

But the goal is never the happiness. 

The journey is.
