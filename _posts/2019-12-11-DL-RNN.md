## Basics of RNN

<a name="intsm"></a>
### <strong>Intuition of Sequence Models</strong>  

These are called sequence modeling:

- Speech recognition
- Music generation
- Sentiment classification
- DNA sequence analysis
- Machine translation
- Video activity recognition
- Name entity recognition
- ......

Forget about the tedious definitions. As a basic intuition of what we are doing in sequence modeling, here is a very simple example:

- We have a sentence: "Pewdiepie and MrBeast are two of the greatest youtubers in human history."
- We want to know: where are the "names" in this sentence? (i.e. name entity recognition)
- We convert the input sentence into $X$: $x^{\langle 1 \rangle}x^{\langle 2 \rangle}...x^{\langle t \rangle}...x^{\langle 12 \rangle}$

    where $x^{\langle t \rangle}$ represents each word in the sentence.  
    
    But how does it represent a word? Notice that we used the capitalized $X$ for a single sentence. Actually, $X.\text{shape}=5000\times12$, and $x.\text{shape}=5000\times1$. Why?
    
    We first make a vocabulary list like $\text{list}=\[\text{a; and; ...; history; ...; MrBeast; ...}]$.
    
    Then, we convert each word into a one-hot vector representing the index of the word in the dictionary, e.g.:
    
    $$\begin{equation}
    x^{\langle 1 \rangle}=\begin{bmatrix}
    0 \\ \vdots \\ 1 \\ \vdots \\ 0
    \end{bmatrix}\longleftarrow 425,\ 
    x^{\langle 2 \rangle}=\begin{bmatrix}
    0 \\ \vdots \\ 1 \\ \vdots \\ 0
    \end{bmatrix}\longleftarrow 3578,\ \cdots\cdots
    \end{equation}$$
    
- We then label the output as $y: 1\ 0\ 1\ 0\ 0\ 0\ 0\ 0\ 0\ 0\ 0\ 0$ and train our NN on this.

- Accordingly, we can use most of the sequences in our daily life as datasets and build our NN models on them to solve such ML problems.

### <strong>Intuition of RNN</strong>

We have very briefly mentioned that Conv1D can be used to scan through a sequence, extract features and make predictions. Then why don't we just stick to Conv1D or use normal ANNs?

1. The scope of sequence modeling is not necessarily recognition or classification, meaning that our inputs & outputs can be in very diff lengths for diff examples. 
2. Neither ANNs nor CNNs share features learned across diff positions of a text or a sequence, whereas context matters quite a lot in most sequence modeling problems.

Therefore, we need to define a brand new NN structure that can perfectly align with sequence modeling - RNN:

<center><img src="../../images/DL/rnn.jpg" height="200"/></center>
<br/>
Forward propagation:
- $a^{\langle 0 \rangle}=\textbf{0}$
- $a^{\langle t \rangle}=g(W_{a}\[a^{\langle t-1 \rangle}; x^{\langle t \rangle}]+b_a)\ \ \ \ \|\ g:\ \text{tanh/ReLU}$  
    
    where $W_a=\[W_{aa}\ W_{ax}]$ with a shape of $(100,10100)$ if we assume a dictionary of 10000 words (i.e. $x^{\langle t \rangle}.\text{shape}=(10000,100)$) and the activation length of 100.

- $\hat{y}^{\langle t \rangle}=g(W_{y}a^{\langle t \rangle}+b_y)\ \ \ \ \|\ g:\ \text{sigmoid}$  

Backward propagation:
- $\mathcal{L}^{\langle t \rangle}(\hat{y}^{\langle t \rangle},y^{\langle t \rangle})=-\sum_i{y_i^{\langle t \rangle}\log{\hat{y}_ i^{\langle t \rangle}}}\ \ \ \ \|\ $Same loss function as LogReg  

<br/><a name="layers"></a>
### <strong>RNN Types</strong>

<center><img src="../../images/DL/rnntypes.png" width="550"/></center>  
<br/>
There is nothing much to explain here. The images are pretty clear.  
<br/><a name="lm"></a>
### <strong>Language Model</strong>

- <u>Intuition of Softmax & Conditional Probability</u>

    The core of RNN is to calculate the likelihood of a sequence: $P(y^{\langle 1 \rangle},y^{\langle 2 \rangle},...,y^{\langle t \rangle})$ and output the one with the highest probability.

    For example, the sequence "<u>the apple and pair salad</u>" has a much smaller possibility to occur than the sequence "<u>the apple and pear salad</u>". Therefore, RNN will output the latter. This seems much like **Softmax**, and indeed it is. 

    Recall from the formula of conditional probability, we can separate the likelihood into:

    $$\begin{equation}
    P\big(y^{\langle 1 \rangle},y^{\langle 2 \rangle},...,y^{\langle t \rangle}\big)=P\big(y^{\langle 1 \rangle}\big)P\big(y^{\langle 2 \rangle}|y^{\langle 1 \rangle}\big)...P\big(y^{\langle t \rangle}|y^{\langle 1 \rangle},y^{\langle 2 \rangle},...,y^{\langle t-1 \rangle}\big)
    \end{equation}$$

    For example, to generate the sentence "I like cats.", we calculate:

    $$\begin{equation}
    P\big(\text{"I like cats"}\big)=P\big(\text{"I"}\big)P\big(\text{"like"}|\text{"I"}\big)P\big(\text{"cats"}|\text{"I like"}\big)
    \end{equation}$$  

- <u>Language Modeling Procedure</u>  
    1. Data Preparation
        * Training set: large corpus of English text (or other languages)
        * **Tokenize**: mark every word into a token
            * \<EOS>: End of Sentence token
            * \<UNK>: Unknown word token
        * e.g. "I hate Minecraft and kids." $\Rightarrow$ "I hate \<UNK> and kids. \<EOS>"  
    <br/>
    2. Training
        <center><img src="../../images/DL/rnnlm.png" width="700"/></center>  
        <br/>
        We use the sentence "I hate Minecraft and kids. \<EOS>" as one training example.  
        At the beginning, we initialize $a^{<0>}$ and $x^{<1>}$ as $\vec{0}$ and let the RNN try to guess the first word.  
        At each step, we use the original word at the same index $y^{\<i-1>}$ and the previous activation $a^{\<i-1>}$ to let the RNN try to guess the next word $\hat{y}^{\<i>}$ from Softmax regression.  
        During the training process, we try to minimize the loss function $\mathcal{L}(\hat{y},y)$ to ensure the training is effective to predict the sentence correctly.
    <br/>
    3. Sequence Sampling
        <center><img src="../../images/DL/rnnsample.png" width="700"/></center>  
        <br>
        After the RNN is trained, we can use it to generate a sentence by itself. In each step, the RNN will take the previous word it generated $\hat{y}^{\<i-1>}$ as $x^{\<i>}$ to generate the next word $\hat{y}^{\<i>}$.
        
- <u>Character-level LM</u>
    - Dictionary
        - Normal LM: \[a, abandon, ..., zoo, \<UNK>]
        - Char-lv LM: \[a, b, c, ..., z]
    - Pros & Cons
        - Pros: never need to worry about unknown words \<UNK>
        - Cons: sequence becomes much much longer; the RNN doesn't really learn anything about the words.  
<br>
- <u>Problems with current RNN</u>  
    One of the most significant problems with our current simple RNN is **vanishing gradients**. As shown in the figures above, the next word always has a very strong dependency on the previous word, and the dependency between two words weakens as the distance between them gets longer. In other words, the current RNN are very bad at catching long-line dependencies, for example,
    
    <center>the <strong>cat</strong>, which already ......, <strong>was</strong> full.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</center>
    <center>the <strong>cats</strong>, which already ......, <strong>were</strong> full.</center>
    <br>
    "be" verbs have high dependencies on the "subject", but RNN doesn't know that. Since the distance between these two words are too long, the gradient on the "subject" nouns would barely affect the training on the "be" verbs.

&emsp;<a name="var"></a>
## RNN Variations

| RNN | GRU | LSTM |
|:---:|:---:|:----:|
| <img src="../../images/DL/rnnblock.png" width="330"/> | <img src="../../images/DL/gru.png" width="330"/> | <img src="../../images/DL/lstm.png" width="330"/> |

As shown above, there are currently 3 most used RNN blocks. The original RNN block activates the linear combination of $a^{\<t-1>}$ and $x^{\<t>}$ with a $\text{tanh}$ function and then passes the output value onto the next block.

However, because of the previously mentioned problem with the original RNN, scholars have created some variations, such as GRU & LSTM.  

<br/><a name="gru"></a>
### <strong>GRU</strong> (Gated Recurrent Unit)

<center><img src="../../images/DL/gru.png" width="400"/></center>  
<br>
As the name implies, GRU is an advancement of normal RNN block with "gates". There are 2 gates in GRU:

- **R gate**: (Remember) determine whether to remember the previous cell
- **U gate**: (Update) determine whether to update the computation with the candidate

Computing process of GRU:

1. Compute R gate:

    $$\begin{equation}
    \Gamma_r=\sigma\big(w_r\big[a^{<t-1>};x^{<t>}\big]+b_r\big)
    \end{equation}$$

2. Compute U gate:

    $$\begin{equation}
    \Gamma_u=\sigma\big(w_u\big[a^{<t-1>};x^{<t>}\big]+b_u\big)
    \end{equation}$$
    
3. Compute Candidate:

    $$\begin{equation}
    \tilde{c}^{<t>}=\tanh{\big(w_c\big[\Gamma_r * a^{<t-1>};x^{<t>}\big]+b_c\big)}
    \end{equation}$$
    
    When $\Gamma_r=0$, $\tilde{c}^{\<t>}=\tanh{\big(w_cx^{\<t>}+b_c\big)}$, the previous word has no effect on the word choice of this cell.
    
4. Compute Memory Cell:

    $$\begin{equation}
    c^{<t>}=\Gamma_u \cdot \tilde{c}^{<t>} + (1-\Gamma_u) \cdot c^{<t-1>}
    \end{equation}$$
    
    When $\Gamma_u=1$, &emsp;$c^{\<t>}=\tilde{c}^{\<t>}$. The candidate updates.  
    When $\Gamma_u=0$, &emsp;$c^{\<t>}=c^{\<t-1>}$. The candidate does not update.
    
5. Output:

    $$\begin{equation}
    a^{<t>}=c^{<t>}
    \end{equation}$$ 

<br/><a name="lstm"></a>
### <strong>LSTM</strong> (Long Short-Term Memory)

<center><img src="../../images/DL/lstm.png" width="400"/></center>  
<br>
LSTM is an advancement of GRU. While GRU relatively saves more computing power, LSTM is more powerful. There are 3 gates in LSTM:

- **F gate**: (Forget) determine whether to forget the previous cell
- **U gate**: (Update) determine whether to update the computation with the candidate
- **O gate**: (Update) Compute the normal activation

Computing process of GRU:

1. Compute F gate:

    $$\begin{equation}
    \Gamma_f=\sigma\big(w_f\big[a^{<t-1>};x^{<t>}\big]+b_f\big)
    \end{equation}$$

2. Compute U gate:

    $$\begin{equation}
    \Gamma_u=\sigma\big(w_u\big[a^{<t-1>};x^{<t>}\big]+b_u\big)
    \end{equation}$$
    
3. Compute O gate:

    $$\begin{equation}
    \Gamma_o=\sigma\big(w_o\big[a^{<t-1>};x^{<t>}\big]+b_o\big)
    \end{equation}$$
    
4. Compute Candidate:

    $$\begin{equation}
    \tilde{c}^{<t>}=\tanh{\big(w_c\big[a^{<t-1>};x^{<t>}\big]+b_c\big)}
    \end{equation}$$
    
5. Compute Memory Cell:

    $$\begin{equation}
    c^{<t>}=\Gamma_u \cdot \tilde{c}^{<t>} + \Gamma_f \cdot c^{<t-1>}
    \end{equation}$$
    
6. Output:

    $$\begin{equation}
    a^{<t>}=\Gamma_o \cdot \tanh{c^{<t>}}
    \end{equation}$$
    
**Peephole Connection**: as shown in the formulae, the gate values $\Gamma \propto c^{\<t-1>}$, therefore, we can always include $c^{\<t-1>}$ into gate calculations to simplify the computing.

<br/><a name="birnn"></a>
### <strong>Bidirectional RNN</strong>

<u>Problem</u>: Sometimes, our choices of previous words are dependent on the latter words. For example,

<center><strong>Teddy</strong> Roosevelt was a nice president.</center>
<center><strong>Teddy</strong> bears are now on sale!!!&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;</center>  
<br>
The word "Teddy" represents two completely different things, but without the context from the latter part, we cannot determine what the "Teddy" stands for. (This example is cited from Andrew Ng's Coursera Specialization)  

<u>Solution</u>: We make the RNN bidirectional:

<center><img src="../../images/DL/birnn.png" height="250"/></center>  
<br>
Each output is calculated as: $\hat{y}^{\<t>}=g\Big(W_y\Big[\overrightarrow{a}^{\<t>};\overleftarrow{a}^{\<t>}\Big]+b_y\Big)$

<br/><a name="drnn"></a>
### <strong>Deep RNN</strong>

Don't be fascinated by the name. It's just stacks of RNN layers:

<center><img src="../../images/DL/drnn.png" width="700"/></center>  

&emsp;
## Word Embeddings

Word embedding is a vectorized representation of a word. Because our PC cannot directly understand the meaning of words, we need to convert these words into numerical values first. So far, we have been using <a name="ohr"></a>**One-hot Encoding**:

$$\begin{equation}
x^{<1>}=\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\ \vdots \\ 1 \\ \vdots \\ 0
\end{bmatrix}\longleftarrow 425,\ 
x^{<2>}=\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\ \vdots \\ 1 \\ \vdots \\ 0
\end{bmatrix}\longleftarrow 3578,\ \cdots\cdots
\end{equation}$$

<u>Problem</u>: our RNN doesn't really learn anything about these words from one-hot representation.

<br/><a name="fr"></a>
### <strong>Featurized Representation</strong>

<u><strong>Intuition:</strong></u> Suppose we have an online shopping review: "Love this dress! Sexy and comfy!", we can represent this sentence as: 

<center><img src="../../images/DL/fr.png" width="600"/></center>  
<br>
We predefine a certain number of features (e.g. gender, royalty, food, size, cost, etc.). 

Then, we give each word (column categories) their relevance to each feature (row categories). As shown in the picture for example, "dress" is very closely related to the feature "gender", therefore given the value "1". Meanwhile, "love" is very closely related to the feature "positive", therefore given the value "0.99".

After we define all the featurized values for the words, we get a vectorized representation of each word:

$$\begin{equation}
\text{love}=e_ {1479}=\begin{bmatrix}
0.03 \\ 0.01 \\ 0.99 \\ 1.00 \\ \vdots
\end{bmatrix},\text{comfy}=e_ {987}=\begin{bmatrix}
0.01 \\ 0.56 \\ 0.98 \\ 0.00 \\ \vdots
\end{bmatrix},\cdots\cdots\end{equation}$$

This way, our RNN will get to know the rough meanings of these words.

For example, when it needs to generate the next word of this sentence: **"I want a glass of orange _____."**

Since it knows that **"orange"** is a **fruit** and that **"glass"** is closely related to **liquid**, there is a much higher possibility that our RNN will choose **"juice"** to fill in the blank.

<u><strong>Embedding matrix:</strong></u> To acquire the word embeddings such as $\vec{e}_ {1479}$ and $\vec{e}_ {987}$ above, we can multiply our embedding matrix with the one-hot encoding:

$$\begin{equation}
E\times \vec{o}_ j=\vec{e}_ j
\end{equation}$$

where $E$ is our featurized representation (i.e. embedding matrix) and $\vec{o}_ j$ is the one-hot encoding of the word (i.e. the index of the word).

In practice, this is too troublesome since the dimensions of our $E$ tend to be huge (e.g. $(500,10000)$). Thus, we use specialized function to look up an embedding directly from the embedding matrix.

<u><strong>Analogies:</strong></u> One of the most useful properties of word embeddings is analogies. For example, **"man $\rightarrow$ woman"="king $\rightarrow$ ?"**.

Suppose we have the following featurized representation:

|  | man | woman | king | queen |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| gender | -1 | 1 | -0.99 | 0.99 |
| royal | 0.01 | 0.02 | 0.97 | 0.96 |
| age | 0.01 | 0.01 | 0.78 | 0.77 |
| food | 0.03 | 0.04 | 0.04 | 0.02 |

In order to learn the analogy, our RNN will have the following thinking process:

$$\begin{align}
&\text{Goal: look for}\ w: \mathop{\arg\max}_ w{sim(e_w, e_{\text{king}}-(e_{\text{man}}-e_{\text{woman}}))} \\
&\because e_{\text{man}}-e_{\text{woman}}\approx\begin{bmatrix}-2 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}, e_{\text{king}}-e_{\text{queen}}\approx\begin{bmatrix}-2 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0\end{bmatrix} \\
&\therefore e_{\text{man}}-e_{\text{woman}}\approx e_{\text{king}}-e_{\text{queen}} \\
&\text{Calculate cosine similarity: } sim(\vec{u},\vec{v})=\cos{\phi}=\frac{\vec{u}^T\vec{v}}{\|\vec{u}\|_ 2\|\vec{v}\|_ 2} \\
&\text{Confirm: }e_w\approx e_{queen}
\end{align}$$

<br/><a name="word2vec"></a>
### Learning 1: <strong>Word2Vec</strong>

<u>Problem</u>: We definitely do not want to write the embedding matrix by ourselves. Instead, we train a NN model to learn the word embeddings.

Suppose we have a sentence "Pewdiepie and MrBeast are two of the greatest youtubers in human history". Before Word2Vec, let's define context & target:

- **Context**: words around target word
    - last 4 words: "two of the greatest ______"
    - 4 words on both sides: "two of the greatest ______ in human history."
    - last 1 word: "greatest ______"
    - **skip-gram**: (any nearby word) "... MrBeast ... ______ ..."
- **Target**: the word we want our NN to generate
    - "youtubers"

<u>Algorithm</u>:

1. **Randomly** choose context & target words with **skip-gram**. (e.g. context "MrBeast" & target "youtubers") 
2. Learn **mapping** of "$c\ (\text{"mrbeast"}\[1234])\rightarrow t\ (\text{"youtubers"}\[765])$"
3. Use **softmax** to calculate the probability of appearance of target given context:

    $$\begin{equation}
    \hat{y}=P(t|c)=\frac{e^{\theta_t^Te_c}}{\sum_{j=1}^{n}{e^{\theta_j^Te_c}}}
    \end{equation}$$

4. Minimize the **loss** function:

    $$\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}(\hat{y},y)=-\sum_{i=1}^{n}{y_i\log{\hat{y}_ i}}
    \end{equation}$$

Notes:
* Computation of softmax is very slow: Hierarchical Softmax (i.e. Huffman Tree + LogReg) can solve this problem - with common words at the top and useless words at the bottom.
* $c\ \&\ t$ should not be entirely random: words like "the/at/on/it/..." should not be chosen.

<br/><a name="negsam"></a>
### Learning 2: <strong>Negative Sampling</strong>

<u>Problem</u>: Given a pair of words, predict whether it's a context-target pair.

For example, given the word "orange" as the context, we want our model to know that "orange & juice" is a context-target pair but "orange & king" is not.

<u>Algorithm</u>:

1. Pick a context-target pair $(c,t)$ (the target should be near the context) from the text corpus as a **positive example**.
2. Pick random words $\\{t_1,\cdots,t_k\\}$ from the dictionary and form word pairs $\\{(c,t_1),\cdots,(c,t_k)\\}$ as **negative examples** based on the following probability that the creator recommended:

    $$\begin{equation}
    P(w_i)=\frac{f(w_i)^{\frac{3}{4}}}{\sum_{j=1}^{n}{f(w_i)^{\frac{3}{4}}}}
    \end{equation}$$

    where $w_i$ is the $i$th word in the dictionary.
    
3. Train a **binary classifier** based on the training examples from previous steps:

    $$\begin{equation}
    \hat{y}_ i=P(y=1|c,t_i)=\sigma(\theta_{t_i}^Te_c)
    \end{equation}$$
    
4. Repeat Step 1-3 till we form our final embedding matrix $E$.  

Negative Sampling is relatively faster and less costly compared to Word2Vec, since it replaces softmax with binary classification.

<br/><a name="glove"></a>
### Learning 3: <strong>GloVe</strong> (Global Vectors)

<u>Problem</u>: Learn word embeddings based on how many times target $i$ appears in context of word $j$.

<u>Algorithm</u>: 

1. Minimize

    $$\begin{equation}
    \sum_{i=1}^{n}{\sum_{j=1}^{n}{f\big(X_{ij}\big)\big(\theta_i^Te_j+b_i+b'_ j-\log{X_{ij}}\big)^2}}
    \end{equation}$$

    * $X_{ij}$: #times $i$ appears in context of $j$
    * $f\big(X_{ij}\big)$: weighing term
        * $f\big(X_{ij}\big)=0$ if $X_{ij}=0$
        * $f\big(X_{ij}\big)$ high for uncommon words
        * $f\big(X_{ij}\big)$ low for too-common words
    * $b_i:t$, $b'_ j:c$

2. Compute the final embedding of word $w$:

    $$\begin{equation}
    e_w^{\text{final}}=\frac{e_w+\theta_w}{2}
    \end{equation}$$

## Sequence Modeling

### <strong>Sentiment Classification</strong>

<br>
<u>Model</u>:

<br/><a name="seq2seq"></a>
### <strong>Seq2Seq</strong>

<u>Problem Setting</u>: (many-to-many) given an entire sequence, generate a new sequence.

<u>Example 1: Machine Translation</u>:

<center><img src="../../images/DL/seq2seq.png" width="550"/></center>  
<br>
Machine Translation vs Language Model:
* Language Model: maximize $P(y^{\<1>},\cdots,y^{\<T_y>})$
* Machine Translation: maximize $P(y^{\<1>},\cdots,y^{\<T_y>} \| \vec{x})$

<u>Example 2: Image Captioning</u>

<center><img src="../../images/DL/seq2seqic.png" width="550"/></center>  

<br/><a name="beam"></a>
### <strong>Beam Search</strong>

<u>Problem</u>: So far, when we choose a word from softmax for each RNN block, we are doing **greedy search**, that we only look for **local optimum** instead of **global optimum**.

That is, we only choose the word with the highest $P(y^{\<1>}\|\vec{x})$ and then the word with the highest $P(y^{\<2>}\|\vec{x})$ and then ...

As we already know, local optimum does not necessarily represent global optimum. In the world of NLP, the word **"going"** always has a much higher probability to appear than the word **"visiting"**, but in certain situations when we need to use "visiting", the algorithm will still choose "going", therefore generating a weird sequence as a whole.

<u>Beam Search Algorithm</u>:

1. Define a beam size of $B$ (usually $B\in\\{1\times10^n,3\times10^n\\},\ n\in\mathbb{Z}^+$).
2. Look at the top $B$ words with the highest $P$s for the first word. (i.e. look for $P(\vec{y}^{\<1>}\|\vec{x})$)
3. Repeat till \<EOS>. Choose the sequence with the highest combined probability.

<u>Improvement</u>: The original Beam Search is very costly in computing, therefore it is necessary to refine it:

$$\begin{align}
&\because P(y^{<1>},\cdots,y^{<T_y>}|x)=\prod_{t=1}^{T_y}{P(y^{<t>}|x,y^{<1>},\cdots,y^{<t-1>})} \\
&\therefore \text{goal}=\mathop{\arg\max}_ y{\prod_{t=1}^{T_y}{P(y^{<t>}|x,y^{<1>},\cdots,y^{<t-1>})}} \\
&\Rightarrow \mathop{\arg\max}_ y{\sum_{t=1}^{T_y}{\log{P(y^{<t>}|x,y^{<1>},\cdots,y^{<t-1>})}}} \\
&\Rightarrow \mathop{\arg\max}_ y{\frac{1}{T_y^{\alpha}}\sum_{t=1}^{T_y}{\log{P(y^{<t>}|x,y^{<1>},\cdots,y^{<t-1>})}}}
\end{align}$$

* $\prod\rightarrow\sum{\log}$: log scaling
* $\frac{1}{T_y^{\alpha}}$: length normalization (when you add more negative values ($\log{(P<1)}<0$), the sum becomes more negative)
* $\alpha$: <strike>learning rate</strike> just a coefficient

<u>Error Analysis</u>: Suppose we want to analyze the following error:

* Human: Jimmy visits Africa in September. ($y^\*$)
* Algorithm: Jimmy visited Africa last September. ($\hat{y}$)

If $P(y^\*\|x)>P(\hat{y}\|x)$, Beam search is at fault $\rightarrow$ increase $B$  
If $P(y^\*\|x)\leq P(\hat{y}\|x)$, RNN is at fault $\rightarrow$ improve RNN (data augmentation, regularization, architecture, etc.)

### <strong>Bleu Score</strong>

<u>Problem</u>: For many sequence modeling problems (especially seq2seq), there is no fixed correct answer. For example, there are many different Chinese translated versions of the same fiction Sherlock Holmes, and they are all correct. In this case, how do we define "correctness" for machine translation? 

<u>Bilingual Evaluation Understudy</u>:

$$\begin{equation}
p_n=\frac{\sum_{\text{n-gram}\in\hat{y}}{\text{count}_ {clip}(\text{n-gram})}}{\sum_{\text{n-gram}\in\hat{y}}{\text{count}(\text{n-gram})}}
\end{equation}$$

* $\text{n-gram}$: $n$ consecutive words (e.g. bigram: "I have a pen." $\rightarrow$ "I have", "have a", "a pen")
* $\text{count}_ {clip}(\text{n-gram})$: maximal #times an n-gram appears in one of the reference sequences
* $\text{count}(\text{n-gram})$: #times an n-gram appears in $\hat{y}$

For example,

* input: "Le chat est sur le tapis."
* Reference 1: "The cat is on the mat."
* Reference 2: "There is a cat on the mat."
* MT output: "the cat the cat on the mat."

The unigrams here are: "the", "cat", "on", "mat". Then,

$$\begin{equation}
p_1=\frac{2+1+1+1}{3+2+1+1}=\frac{5}{7}
\end{equation}$$

The bigrams here are: "the cat", "cat the", "cat on", "on the", "the mat". Then,

$$\begin{equation}
p_2=\frac{1+0+1+1+1}{2+1+1+1+1}=\frac{2}{3}
\end{equation}$$

The final Bleu score will be calculated as:

$$\begin{equation}
\text{BLEU}=\frac{1+0+1+1+1}{2+1+1+1+1}=\frac{2}{3}
\end{equation}$$
